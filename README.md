# Inferences:

If you want to become data scientist, the below inferences can help you

##### Programming Languages Used
- Python and R are most used programming languages irrespective of the field of the work and they are outperforming other.
- Compared to R language, python is far more used.

##### Learning Platforms
- Kaggle is the most used learning platform and found useful.
- Top resources that are useful for learning are Kaggle, Stack Overflow, Online Courses, Youtube, Project, Blogs etc.
- People who learnt from Friends, Podcasts, Trade Books, Communities, Tutoring, arxiv found not that much useful.
- It is observed that number of people who used Youtube for learning are greater than Projects but the usefullness of Projects is more.( For more details check jupyter notebook).

##### Job Skills
- Even though python is mostly asked skill throughout many fields, SQL is the most preffered job skill for data scientists position followed by R,Data Visualisation.

##### Algorithms Used
- Top methods used by Data Scientists are Data visualisations, cross-validation, Gradient Boosting, Ensembles etc.
- Top methods used by Statisticians are logistic regressions, Prescriptive modelling, Cross validation, PCA etc.
- Top methods used by Machine Learning Engineers are Data visualisations, cross-validation, NLP, Neural Networks, CNN etc
- Top methods used by Software Emgineers are Data visualisations, cross-validation, Gradient Boosting, Ensembles etc. (Check the report for detailed analysis).

##### Tools
- Python, SQL, R, Jupyter etc are the tools widely used by Data Scientists.
- R, Excel, SASBase, SQL etc are the tools widely used by Statisticians.
- Python, SQL, AWS, R etc are the tools widely used by Machine Learning Engineers.
- Python, SQL, Unix, Java etc are the tools widely used by the Software Engineers.

##### Majors
- There was always a question on what Major a person should choose to get into a specified path.
- Its clear from the data that Major will not be an obstacle.

##### Path to become data scientist
- Learn Python Language Since it is mostly used programming Languages by Data Scientists followed by R (second most preffered language).
- Use Learning Resources such as Kaggle, StackOverflow, Youtube, Online Courses and Projects to become a good Data Scientist.
- To excel your career as Data Scientist, the major job skills required are SQL, visualizations etc. as most of the companies prefer them.
- Learn the top methods used by Datascients such as Data visualisations, cross-validation, Gradient Boosting, Ensembles etc.
- Get a grip on tools such as Python, SQL, R, Jupyter etc
- To become a Data Scientist, Major you are going to pursue will not be an obstacle. But most of the Data Scientists come from Computer Science, Engineering, Statisticians backgrounds. Choosing them as a Major may slightly benifit you.
